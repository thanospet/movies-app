Hello ! 

This is a small guide to run the project.

1. Navigate to => movies-rent-app , and run : npm run dev
2. Navigate to  => movies-rent-app => backend and run : node server.js

The backend is using express to bypass the CORS errors. 

Be aware of possible changes you may have to do in order to make the server run in your local machine.

Thanks.
